Architect- Licensed in Missouri
Architectural Design Posted Dec 17, 2024
Hi,

We have a project with a very tight deadline. Its a multifamily complex of 15 buildings. We need drawings for the city for replacing the wood balconies. The city is requiring a site plan, elevations, and details. They are not requiring elevations for each building, just typical elevations and marked on the site plan where the elevations are. We can give over all the information remotely. I am not sure what the licensing requirments are for architects in Missouri for these types of drawings on a multi family dwelling.
------------------
Dear Client
Thank you for reaching out with details about your multifamily complex project. I understand the urgency and requirements involved and would be happy to assist you in preparing the necessary drawings for submission to the city.
Below is my bid proposal:

- Site Plan
A detailed site plan identifying all 15 buildings, marked with the locations of the wood balconies requiring replacement.
- Typical Elevations
Representative elevations for the buildings, marked and referenced on the site plan.
- Details
Construction details for wood balcony replacement to comply with city requirements and building codes.

Based on your location in Missouri, architectural licensing requirements may vary depending on the scope and complexity of the project. I will collaborate with a Missouri-licensed architect (if required) to ensure compliance. Alternatively, I can assist in preparing drawings under your direction if no license is necessary.

To begin, I will require the following:
1. Any existing site plans or building layouts.
2. Photos or drawings of the wood balconies being replaced.
3. The city’s requirements or guidelines for submission.
4. Any additional details about the materials or design preferences for the balconies.
Please let me know if you’d like to proceed, and I can send over a formal agreement to start immediately.
Best regards,
Shane Boland

Architectural Review for Residential Apartment Layouts - Interior Design and Livability
Architectural Design Posted Dec 18, 2024
I am seeking the services of a skilled architectural reviewer with expertise in interior design and space functionality to evaluate the layout for a residential apartment building complex. The layout has been designed by our project architect and includes typical floor plans for the complex. The objective is to refine the design, ensuring it meets optimal standards for interior design, functional use, and livability.

Responsibilities:

Review Architectural Drawings:

Analyze the layouts prepared by the architect, including unit floor plans and common areas.
Assess the design from an interior design perspective, focusing on space functionality and livability.
Provide Feedback:

Suggest areas for improvement or modifications to enhance the usability and aesthetics of the spaces.
Identify any potential issues with space allocation for essential appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, and other household items.
Lighting and Ventilation:

Recommend changes to improve natural lighting and ventilation in the apartments and common areas.
Annotations and Reporting:

Provide clear feedback through annotations directly on the drawings.
Summarize feedback in a detailed tabular format, highlighting suggestions and their rationale.
Maintain Original Design Integrity:

Ensure recommendations align with the structural limitations of the project.
Propose minor adjustments to walls, columns, and orientations as needed, without departing significantly from the original design.

Deliverables:

1. Annotated architectural drawings with specific suggestions for improvement.
2. A tabular summary of recommendations, detailing issues identified and proposed solutions.




Thanks for reaching out.
To ensure I fully understand your project and deliver exactly what you're looking for, I have a few detailed questions:

1. Are there specific areas within the apartment complex that you want me to focus on more than others (e.g., kitchens, living spaces, bathrooms)?
2. Would you like me to focus exclusively on interior functionality, or should the review include considerations for the exterior layout (e.g., balcony access, common area designs)?
3. Are there any specific appliance or furniture requirements for each unit (e.g., size and placement of refrigerators, washing machines, dryers)?
4. Are there particular furniture pieces you want to ensure can be comfortably accommodated in living spaces?
5. Do you have any preferences for maximizing natural light in certain rooms (e.g., bedrooms, kitchens)?
6. How important is cross-ventilation in the layout of the apartments? Are there specific areas where ventilation is a concern?
7. Can you clarify what "common areas" include in your design (e.g., lobby, hallways, gyms, lounges)? Are there any specific functional requirements for these spaces?
8. Are there any accessibility or universal design requirements for the common areas?
Thanks again
Shane
